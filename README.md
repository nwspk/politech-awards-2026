# Political Technology Awards 2026

The Political Technology Awards is an open evaluation exercise run by the 2025–26 [Newspeak House](https://newspeak.house) fellowship cohort. We're building a public, inspectable ranking of civic and political technology projects — the kind of tools that help citizens understand institutions, participate in democracy, and hold power to account.

**How we evaluate:** We use a scoring algorithm that evolves over time. Each version applies different heuristics (governance signals, civic impact, data completeness, etc.) and produces a ranked list from our [longlist](candidates.csv) of 321 projects. The algorithm lives in this repo; you can inspect the code, the pull requests, and the rationale for every change. We may add written assessments per project as the evaluation matures.

**Why this matters:** Rankings are political. By making our process transparent and iterative, we hope to surface both strong projects and the tradeoffs inherent in any evaluation framework.

The committee iterates on the algorithm through pull requests. Each PR proposes a new heuristic; the timeline of proposals forms the basis of our public statement on process and legitimacy.

## How It Works

1. **Propose** — Have an idea but no code? Open a [Heuristic suggestion](https://github.com/nwspk/politech-awards-2026/issues/new?template=heuristic-suggestion.md) issue (same fields as the PR template), then tag **@sugaroverflow** to implement it. If you're ready with code, open a PR — the template auto-fills.
2. **Bot runs** — When the PR is marked "Ready for review", a bot runs the algorithm, posts results, and assigns a version number.
3. **Vote** — Committee members vote with 👍 / 👎 on the voting comment. Majority of those who vote wins; abstentions don't count. PR author (if in the committee) counts as yes when abstaining.
4. **Merge or close** — Approved PRs get merged; rejected ones get closed.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npx tsx the-algorithm.ts   # runs the algorithm, writes results.json
```

Edit `the-algorithm.ts` to add your heuristic, then open a PR.

## Iterations

<!-- ITERATIONS:START -->

| Version | Heuristic | Top Project | PR |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| v1 | Random score between 1 and 100 | relationaltechproject.org | [v1](https://github.com/nwspk/politech-awards-2026/pull/1) |
| v2 | Random base score (1-100) + inclusion bonus based on exclusion keywords in URL | civicmatch.app | [v2](https://github.com/nwspk/politech-awards-2026/pull/2) |
| v3 | Removing the random scoring tilt mechanism by trying to score projects by keyword clusters. Each project receives points if the URL (the only data we currently have) matches across the 4 policy-framework-aligned keyword clusters. | benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk | [v3](https://github.com/nwspk/politech-awards-2026/pull/7) |
| v4 | Base score (50) + inclusion bonus (URL keywords) − fetch-failure penalty (10) + AI-body bonus (up to 15). Uses cached page fetches to penalise dead/inaccessible sites and reward projects whose page content mentions AI governance, safety, or policy keywords. | algorithmwatch.org | [v4](https://github.com/nwspk/politech-awards-2026/pull/9) |

### v4

- **Top project**: [algorithmwatch.org](https://algorithmwatch.org) (score: 65)
- **Heuristic**: Base score (50) + inclusion bonus (URL keywords) − fetch-failure penalty (10) + AI-body bonus (up to 15). Uses cached page fetches to penalise dead/inaccessible sites and reward projects whose page content mentions AI governance, safety, or policy keywords.
- **Rationale**: v3 showed that URL-only matching yields almost no signal. This iteration fetches each project's homepage, caches the HTML, and uses the cached body to surface projects that explicitly discuss AI governance, safety, or policy. Sites that fail to fetch receive a penalty.
- **Data sources**: project URL, cached page body
- **Keywords**: benefits, housing, refugee, migrant, asylum, eviction, homeless, disability, accessibility, low-income, AI alignment, AI governance, AI safety
- **Limitations**: Requires cache to be populated (npm run cache:sites). AI bonus capped at 3 keyword matches × 5 points.

### v3

- **Top project**: [benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk](https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk) (score: 11)
- **Heuristic**: Removing the random scoring tilt mechanism by trying to score projects by keyword clusters. Each project receives points if the URL (the only data we currently have) matches across the 4 policy-framework-aligned keyword clusters.
- **Rationale**: v2 showed that keyword matching against URLs can surface relevant projects — but the random base score meant that it was different each time it was run, which isn't very reliable. This iteration removes randomness entirely to ask:  

**what can keyword clusters alone tell us about 321 projects when our only data source is a URL string?**

It turns out the answer is: almost nothing. Only 2 of 321 projects score above baseline. We can probably consider this a failure of our dataset which is only URLs.
- **Data sources**: project URL, additional data files
- **Proposed** by sugaroverflow on 2026-02-07
- **PR**: [v3](https://github.com/nwspk/politech-awards-2026/pull/7)

### v2

- **Top project**: [civicmatch.app](https://civicmatch.app) (score: 100)
- **Heuristic**: Random base score (1-100) + inclusion bonus based on exclusion keywords in URL
- **Rationale**: The exclusion-focused scoring heuristic is intentionally crude: a keyword-based bonus derived from the project URL. It's meant to make political values legible and contestable, not definitive. The heuristic biases scores toward projects addressing populations most likely to be excluded from government services (inspired by GovCamp digital inclusion discussions).
- **Data sources**: project URL
- **Keywords**: benefits, housing, refugee, migrant, asylum, eviction, homeless, disability, accessibility, low-income
- **Limitations**: Only matches keywords in the URL string itself, not in actual project content. Many relevant projects won't have these keywords in their URL.
- **Proposed** by Asil on 2026-02-04
- **PR**: [v2](https://github.com/nwspk/politech-awards-2026/pull/2)

### v1

- **Top project**: [relationaltechproject.org](https://relationaltechproject.org)
- **Heuristic**: Random score between 1 and 100
- **Data sources**: project URL
- **Limitations**: Entirely random; no meaningful evaluation of projects.
- **PR**: [v1](https://github.com/nwspk/politech-awards-2026/pull/1)
