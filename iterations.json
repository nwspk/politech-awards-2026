This iteration removes randomness entirely to ask:  \r\n\r\n**what can keyword clusters alone tell us about 321 projects when our only data source is a URL string?**\r\n\r\nIt turns out the answer is: almost nothing. Only 2 of 321 projects score above baseline. We can probably consider this a failure of our dataset which is only URLs.",
