## What data is this adding?

<!-- Describe the new data you're bringing in.
     e.g. "Scraped project descriptions from each URL"
     or "GitHub star counts for repos in the longlist"
     or "Committee member rankings from the pairwise survey" -->



## Source

<!-- Where does this data come from? How was it collected? -->



## Coverage

<!-- How many of the 321 projects does this data cover?
     It's fine if it's partial — the algorithm handles missing data. -->



## Notes

<!-- Anything else? e.g. data format, known gaps, refresh frequency -->
