## Heuristic

<!-- One sentence: what does your scoring approach do? -->



## Rationale

<!-- Why is this a good change? What values does it encode or contest?
     Include any specific keywords, criteria, or known limitations here.
     This is the most important part — be as detailed as you like. -->



## Assessment

<!-- Feel free to leave this blank and come back after the bot posts
     the project results — it's easier to write once you can see
     which projects scored highest, lowest, and in the middle.

     When you're ready, write a short assessment:
     - Do the results make sense? Are there surprises?
     - What does this heuristic get right? What does it miss?
     - What data or approach would improve the next iteration? -->



## Implementation

- [ ] Just an idea — I need help coding this up
- [ ] Code is ready to review
